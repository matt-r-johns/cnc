# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a passionate CNC Machinist and Applications Engineer. I enjoy all aspects of the trade — from complex 5-axis programming to making chips on a manual lathe. I'm driven by my desire to learn new skills, creating repeatable and optimised workflows, and passing my knowledge on to future generations of machinists and programmers.
